# dsp
A collection of DSP methods written in Max/MSP and Reaktor.

All Max/MSP objects listed below have multichannel equivalents included alongside them: just prefix any object ending in `~` with `mc.` to use these.

## Max/MSP

### Synths and oscillators

* additive\~. An additive oscillator with up to 11 harmonics, each with adjustable amplitudes.

* extractor\~. Uses extractor-fft, contained in the same directory.

* fffbnoise\~. An oscillator generated by passing white noise through 11 tuned fast fixed bandpass filters.

* vstmorph\~, vstmorph3\~, vstmorph4\~. Allows you to select or create two, three or four different VST presets respectively, and linearly interpolate between them.

* vstseed\~. Allows you to randomise selected parameters of a VST within a desired range. If you obtain a setting you like, you can "plant a seed" and have this setting be the basis for further randomisation.

## Reaktor

### Effects

* spatialiser and spatialiser-mono. Lets you place a stereo or mono sound in the 2D plane and move it around. Adds appropriate phase-shifting, delay based on distance, spreading losses, and configurable levels of accoustic attenuation.
