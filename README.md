# dsp
A collection of DSP methods written in Max/MSP and Reaktor.

All signal-rate objects listed below have multichannel equivalents included alongside them: just prefix any object ending in `~` with `mc.` to use these.

## Max/MSP

### Synths and oscillators

* additive\~. An additive oscillator with up to 11 harmonics, each with adjustable amplitudes.

* extractor\~. Uses extractor-fft, contained in the same directory.

* fffbnoise\~. An oscillator generated by passing white noise through 11 tuned fast fixed bandpass filters.

* vstmorph\~, vstmorph3\~, vstmorph4\~.

* vstseed\~.

## Reaktor

### Effects

* spatialiser and spatialiser-mono.
